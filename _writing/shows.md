The goal with a show post is to explain what the show is about, but you'll notice we broke things up into the sections.

If there are big spoilers, put them down in the notable queer episodes and timelines section. If people are looking there on purpose, they deserve what they get.

## Title

The official title of the show. For example, _CSI: Crime Scene Investigation_ and not _CSI_. This means, yes, if they call it _Venice: The Series_ so do we. If two shows have the same name, indicate the least popular (or the second one) with a parenthetical. The American version of _24_ is simply called that, but the Indian version is called _24 (Indian)_.

## Post Content

An overview of the show. We're not looking for novels, just a description of what the show is, what it's about, who's in it. It's okay to be silly and goofy and weird (see _Lost Girl_) so long as you can be informative.

### Tagged

This is extra tags used by the similar shows code.

### TV Show Image

AKA Featured image. It should be at least 960x400 pixels. This will be both the header image for the post as well as the 'thumbnail' for the show listing page. Make it as gay as possible.

### Excerpt

This is what will display on the show listing page, so keep it witty, keep it pretty, keep it gay. And yes, customize it

* Bronze Stars: Made by queers for anyone
* Anti Star: Made by straights for queers (used only for _BAD_ shows)

**Trigger Warnings:**

If the show has some stomach turning scenes or ever flashes one of those "if you're thinking about suicide..." warnings, it probably needs this.

### Worth It, Details & Love

* Worth: Yes, Meh, No. Be honest. If you haven't seen it, use TDB.
* Details: Explain why some lesbians wince at The L Word. (Note: If you picked TBD for Worth It, this will _not_ display)
* Loved It?: A simple checkbox. Yes or no. Most everything is no. Above all else, this is a show everyone loves. Only use if you are a billion percent sure and have cleared it with Tracy _and_ Mika.

_OPTIONAL_ - Shows we also have on the site that we think people would also like. Pick up to 6.

## Relativistic Ratings

![Relativistic Ratings]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/shows/relative.png)

Ratings are where we review and describe how much the show is awesome. All of these fields are optional, but it's nice if we can explain it. Ratings are scored 0 to 5, and details are why the score is what it is.

* Realness: 1 means the show is not even close to real for how lesbians are, a 5 means this is like life. A show like _Lost Girl_ gets a 4 on the realness scale because it handles polyamory and bisexuality very well, but is weirdly transphobic.
* Quality: If the lesbians are real, so's the show, right? Nope! Some shows are outright terrible while still having weirdly accurate lesbians. Again, 1 is bad quality, 5 is awesome. A 0 would be "Everyone dies."
* Screen Time: 1 means _Friends_, where we get an episode or two a season. A 5 means _The L Word_ or _Take My Wife_. 0 means 'they mentioned queers...' which normally we wouldn't even bother, but sometimes it matters.

## Plot and Relationship Details

![Plot and Relationship Details]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/shows/plot-relationship.png)

This is where we break down the details of the show. All of these fields are optional, but it's nice if we can explain it.

* Ship Names: Separate multiple ship names with commas
* Queer Plots Timeline: Write up an overview of the plot lines that are gay. If only three seasons are gay, just talk about those three seasons.
* List all the episodes that are super gay.

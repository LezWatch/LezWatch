The goal with a show post is to explain what the show is about, but you'll notice we broke things up into the sections.

## Title

The official title of the show. For example, _CSI: Crime Scene Investigation_ and not _CSI_. This means, yes, if they call it _Venice: The Series_ so do we. If two shows have the same name, indicate the least popular (or the second one) with a parenthetical. The American version of _24_ is simply called that, but the Indian version is called _24 (Indian)_.

## Base Content

### Post Content

An overview of the show. We're not looking for novels, just a description of what the show is, what it's about, who's in it. It's okay to be silly and goofy and weird (see _Lost Girl_) so long as you can be informative.

### Excerpt

This is what will display on the show listing page, so keep it witty, keep it pretty, keep it gay. And yes, customize it.

## Sidebar

### TV Show Image

AKA Featured image. It should be at least 960x400 pixels. This will be both the header image for the post as well as the 'thumbnail' for the show listing page. Make it as gay as possible.

### Nation

What country did the show originate from? This is also free-form text.

### TV Stations

ABC, NBC, FOX, BBC 1. You get the idea. If the show airs on YouTube, use that. This is free-form so you can add what you want.

### Additional Data

This section contains extra data:

#### Air Dates

What years did the show air? You can set the second year to 'Current' if it's still airing. Right now you can't future-date show. Sorry.

#### Seasons

The number of seasons.

#### Show Format

This is a dropdown from the custom taxonomy of "Show Format." It lists the possible formats (TV Show, TV Movie, Mini Series, or Web Series).

### IMDb TD

This is freeform text but should be the ID: tt123456

### Genres

What _kind_ of show is this? Anime? Mystery? The values will auto-complete and you can add multiple entries.

#### Stars

* Gold Stars: Shows about queer females, written by queer females.
* Silver Stars: Shows about queers in general, male or female
* Bronze Stars: Made by queers for anyone
* Anti Star: Made by straights for queers (used only for _BAD_ shows)

#### Trigger Warning?

If the show has some stomach turning scenes or ever flashes one of those "if you're thinking about suicide..." warnings, it probably needs this.

* High: _Game of Thrones_, _Law & Order SVU_, _The 100_
* Med: _Law & Order CI_, _CSI_
* Low: _Law & Order_

## Must See Details

This really really really needs to be filled in. Like I'd love to block publish if they were missing.

### Trope Plots

Start typing to fill in the content. "Law Enforcement" includes PIs and military.

### Worth It?

Yes, Meh, No. Be honest. If you haven't seen it, use TDB.

### Worth It Details

And now we have to explain why some lesbians wince at The L Word. (Note: If you picked TBD for Worth It, this will _not_ display)

### Show We Love

A checkbox. Yes or no. Most everything is no. Above all else, this is a show everyone loves. Only use if you are a billion percent sure and have cleared it with Tracy _and_ Mika.

### Watch Online Link(s)

Paste in a direct link. Amazon, Apple, and CBS links will be auto-converted to affiliate links. Examples:

## Relativistic Ratings

Ratings are where we review and describe how much the show is awesome. All of these fields are optional, but it's nice if we can explain it.

### Realness Ratings

1 means the show is not even close to real for how lesbians are, a 5 means this is like life. A show like _Lost Girl_ gets a 4 on the lesbian realness scale because it handles polyamory and bisexuality very well, but is weirdly transphobic.

### Realness Details

Since _Lost Girl_ is so real (surprise!) it has to be explained why it's so high.

### Show Quality Rating

If the lesbians are real, so's the show, right? Nope! Some shows are outright terrible while still having weirdly accurate lesbians. Again, 1 is bad quality, 5 is awesome.

### Show Quality Details

I'm picking on _Lost Girl_ a lot, but here again it's an amazingly high quality show, with both makeup and acting.

### Screen Time Rating

A 1 means _Friends_, where we get an episode or two a season. A 5 means _The L Word_ or _Take My Wife_. 0 means 'they mentioned queers...' which normally we wouldn't even bother, but sometimes it matters.

### Screen Time Details

The _L Word_ gets the highest rating ever for a reason. Explain that here. For _Friends_ it needed reminding that the show was not about the lesbians, and they were only there for the 'backup' of Ross etc.

## Plot and Relationship Details

This is where we break down the details of the show. All of these fields are optional, but it's nice if we can explain it.

### Ship Names

Separate multiple ship names with commas

### Queer Plots Timeline

Write up an overview of the plot lines that are gay. If only three seasons are gay, just talk about those three seasons.

### Notable Lez-Centric Episodes

List all the episodes that are super gay. The format is as follows:

* __Season # Episode # “Episode Title”__ - Episode description.

Do not worry about spoilers in this section. If someone's reading about notable queer episodes and timelines, they deserve what they get. If it's for a show like _Lost Girl_ or _The L Word_ then it's okay to just say 'all of them' but if there was a seminal episode that changed the world (like "The Puppy Episode" for _Ellen_) then that's what we want.

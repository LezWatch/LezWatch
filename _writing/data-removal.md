While the best case is we never have to remove data, there are some actors who would like their data removed. When that happens, we have two options to present to them.

In all cases, remember to explain what's going on in the Internal Information box, located on all show, actor, and character pages:

![Internal Info]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/admin-internal-info.jpg)

Enter in who was removed and why from the character page, as well as the actor. This will allow us to restore data if needed, while respecting their privacy.

## Removal of Personal Data

For this, just empty out all the data. Remove the bio, any social media, the birthday, etc. Put the data into the Internal Information "Notes" field with an explanation as to what happened. If necessary remove the image as well.

## Complete Removal

If they want a full removal, set the page to private and enter in why in the Internal Information "Notes" field. This will make the page invisible to non-logged-in users, however admins will still see it. To make sure we know what's going on, you will see a notice on front and back end of the page to explain it's private and why.

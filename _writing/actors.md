The goal with an actor page is to briefly explain who the person is and why they mater.

## Title

The name of the actor. Pick the name they're best known by.

* Honor the cultures that use family name first (ex: Shida Yui)
* Use an alias/alternate name if they're better known by that

## Content

Who is the person. This can be as long as needed. Don't repeat anything we cover elsewhere (like birthday).

## Sidebar

## Actor Photo

Pick the best headshot you can, and don't worry about licensing right now.

### Gender Identity

Cis, agender, non-binary... Pick the best one you can. If a person identifies as one, take them at their word. This means! If you hit someone who has a gender we don't have listed _we add it_, no questions asked.

### Sexuality

Homosexual, Bisexual, Asexual, Heterosexual, Unknown, etc... Default to heterosexual. If you can't tell and are working on a webseries, default to **Unknown**.

## Internal Notes

You can leave a Staff Note. Generally this is for take down requests, so we can know why a page was removed and what the data was before. It doesn't show up publicly.

The goal with an actor page is to briefly explain who the person is and why they matter.

## Title

The name of the actor. Pick the name they're best known by.

* Honor the cultures that use family name first (ex: Shida Yui)
* Use an alias or nickname if they're better known by that (ex: Kat Barell)

## Content

Who is the person? This can be as long as needed. Don't repeat anything we cover elsewhere (like birthday). If they have an official bio, you can crib from that.

## Sidebar

### Actor Photo

Pick the best headshot you can, and don't worry about licensing right now.

## Additional Data

Below the content is a lot of extra data. Please fill this in as best you can.

* Gender Identity - If you find someone who has a gender we don't have listed _we add it_, no questions asked.
* Sexuality - Default to heterosexual. If you can't tell and are working on a webseries, default to **Unknown**.

Everything else should be pretty obvious.

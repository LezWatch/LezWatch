The goal with a character post is to briefly explain who the person is and why they matter.

## Title

The name of the character. Pick the name they're best known by.

* Honor the cultures that use family name first (ex: Shida Yui)
* Use an alias/alternate name if they're better known by that (ex: Thirteen, Adam Torres)
* If a character switches names during the show you can use the 'first' name first and separate with a slash (ex: Moira/Max)
* If the character has only one name, and it's really common that's okay WordPress will add a `-2` to the post name
* If you find someone's name, update the name and the slug (ex: Courtney / `courtney` became Courtney Brown / `courtney-brown`). Since we have Yoast SEO, it can be used to redirect the old post name.

## Content

The post content should be short and to the point.

### Character Photo

Pick the best headshot you can.

## Additional Data

There's a lot going on here, we know.

### Gender Identity, Sexuality, Romantic Orientation

Pick the best one you can. If a character identifies as one, take them at their word. We default to Cisgender Homosexual with no romantic orientation. If you have _no_ idea what that last one means, keep it at 'none'. Mostly this happens with LGBT web series.

### Death

If they're dead, pick the real life (not in show universe), date. Generally it will be the episode airdate unless they died off camera. In that case, pick either the episode date where it's stated they're dead _or_ if you can figure out which episode they died in, use that. Good luck. If you can't tell, go for the closest date possible.

### Character Clichés

We're looking for things like 'parent' and 'queer IRL' - Every character has a cliché. Even if it's vegetarian. None should be the absolute last resort. The goal is to have everyone with a cliché that _isn't_ "none".

### Actor Name

If there are multiple actors, add multiple rows. Put the most known actor (or the most current) on top. Use 'Unknown' as an absolute last resort.

### Shows

This section is a repeatable field.

* Show Name - This is a dropdown. If the show isn't listed, that's okay you can leave it blank. It's best to add the show, even if we don't publish it, just so it can be filled in later. You can add a new row if someone is on multiple shows (Lucretia from the _Spartacus_ series, Janet King from her own show and _Crownies_, for example).
* Character Type - Main cast is easy. Recurring and guest are semantics. If they have their own plot, they're probably recurring. If they only have one episode, they're probably guests.

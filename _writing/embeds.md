[Embeds](https://codex.wordpress.org/Embeds) are a concept within WordPress that lets you ... well ... embed content by pasting a URL on it's own line.

In addition to all the defaults in WordPress (YouTube, Twitter, etc), the following sites have support added:

* IndieGoGo
* Gleam

## Examples:

https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/riley-parra-season-2-lgbt

https://gleam.io/iR0GQ/gleam-demo-competition

Yep, just paste that on a line all it's own and WordPress handles the rest.

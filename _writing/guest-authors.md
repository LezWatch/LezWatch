If you've [submitted an article to us](https://lezwatchtv.com/about/submissions/) here's how the process works:

## Review

An editor reviews the post for any obvious errors (Black Lightening vs Black Lightning). Formatting may be altered to break up long paragraphs. This is done in Google Docs, which will allow you to see any changes and approve them before the article is added to the site.

## Account Creation

An author account will be created on the site with the your provided email and bio. This will allow you to be able to link others to a page listing their articles. You will have access to customize their bio and favorite shows at any time.

In order to add a custom avatar to the site, you will need to use [Gravatar](https://en.gravatar.com) -- sign up with the same email you used and it will automatically be added. One Gravatar account can manage multiple emails.

## Final Review

The post will be imported for you from Google Docs and reviewed one last time. Then it will be scheduled for publication.

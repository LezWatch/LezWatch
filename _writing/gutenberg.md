For people who are new to Gutenberg it can be a serious paradigm shift in how you write with WordPress.

Deep breath.

Most everything is "just write." If you have a twitter link, or a video, just paste in the URL into an empty line (aka a block) and it will auto convert. We have created custom blocks to make certain repeatable actions easier.

## Author Box

Insert an author box. Generally you won't need this so don't worry. I know it's ugly.

## Listicles

Type `/listicle` into a fresh line on Gutenberg:

![Listicle Example]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/gutenberg/listicle-example.jpg)

Click on "Listicle" and it will generate a block that has two options for Listicle items.

Each item gets a title and then below it you can add content. Use the buttons at the bottom to add or remove items. If you want to have a reverse list (for a countdown) you can use the "Toggle Order" to reverse.

## Screeners

Inserts a customizable Screener block. Use this for shows you review pre-airing.

## Spoilers

Inserts an editable spoiler warning.

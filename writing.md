So you're ready to write a post? Awesome, let's do this!

## The Rules

* Anyone can write a post about anything.
* Anyone can edit a post about anything.
* Anyone can update anything they have access to update.

If you have access then you have permission to edit the site. We're cool people here, and we respect each other so don't worry about fixing spelling or correcting mistakes.

If you're really worried, jump on Slack and ping people.

If someone else is posting a blog post, try to wait till the next day and space them out, but if it's breaking news, all bets are off.

## Multiple Authors

Two lesbians, six opinions. Since we don't always like the same shows, we've devised a way for multiple people to review a show (or a character) and we made is simple.

The first person to review a show writes in their voice. If a second person comes along, they will add in the first author's name in bold above their comments, and then their own name in bold above there own. For a full example, check out The L Word.

Short example:

> Mika:
> I love this show!
>
> Tracy:
> I hate this show!

It's not alphabetical, it's first come, first words.

## Content

All characters on all TV shows, no matter the country of origin, is fair game for the site. This includes web series. It does not include Reality TV or Docudramas. Docudramas are based on real people, which violates the 'no real people' clause. The only exception is when TV characters are actors playing TV versions of themselves. For example, Emma Thompson played herself, only gay, on the original Ellen.

For more information see how to write TV Show and Character posts.

## Custom Post Types and Taxonomies

There are three custom post types (CPTs) on this site: TV Shows, Actors, and Characters. They make up the database.

Each post type represents one item. So a TV Show CPT is an individual show, and so on. In addition, each post type has a number of custom taxonomies to be used to organize data.

### Taxonomies per post type

* TV Shows: TV Stations, Tropes`*`, Formats`*`, Genres`*`, Nations, Stars, Triggers, Intersections`*`
* Actors: Genders, Sexualitys
* Characters: Cliches`*`, Genders, Sexual Orientation, and Romantic Orientation

These fields either auto complete or are selectable via dropdowns.

If you need to add a new Nation or Station, you can do so via the post editor. If you need to add in more genders or romantic orientations, you will need to edit the taxonomy (available via the menu).

Keep in mind, certain taxonomies (indicated with a `*`) use symbolicons (see below). They also shouldn't be added too all that often. If you need help, grab Mika.

### Symbolicons

Ahhhh. Symbolicons. The basic idea was to add in pretty, cool, pictures to all the taxonomies and have them cross link back and forth to the show and character pages. In order to do this, some pretty weird code was written into the theme.

In order to force things properly, you cannot add to certain taxonomies from the post editor. The only one you can is for TV Stations. Everything else has to be managed via the taxonomy editor for a reason. When you add a new item to the taxonomy, you have to add in a symbolic icon (see? symbolicon) from the dropdown menu.

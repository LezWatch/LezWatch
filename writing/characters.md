The goal with a character post is to briefly explain who the person is and why they mater.

## Title

The name of the character. Pick the name they're best known by.

* Honor the cultures that use family name first (ex: Shida Yui)
* Use an alias/alternate name if they're better known by that (ex: Thirteen, Adam Torres)
* If a character switches names during the show you can use the 'first' name first and separate with a slash (ex: Moira/Max)
* If the character has only one name, and it's really common that's okay, just change the slug to have the show: courtney-er
* If you find someone's name, update the name and the slug (ex: Courtney / courtney-er became Courtney Brown / courtney-brown). Since we have Yoast SEO, it redirects it for us.

## Content

The post content should be short and to the point. Two or three sentences.

## Sidebar

## Character Photo

Pick the sexiest headshot you can, and don't worry about licensing.

### Gender Identity

Cis, agender, non-binary... Pick the best one you can. If a character identifies as one, take them at their word.

### Sexuality

Homosexual, Bisexual, Asexual, Heterosexual, Undefined, etc... Default to homosexual. Undefined should be restricted to babies.

### Romantic

Defaults to 'none' and if you have _no_ idea what that means, keep it there. Mostly this happens with LGBT web series.

### Death

If they're dead, pick the real life (not in show universe), date. Generally it will be the episode airdate.

## Character Details

The details about the character will tell us what we need to know.

### Character Clichés

We're looking for things like 'parent' and 'queer IRL' - Every character has a cliché. Even if it's vegetarian. None should be the absolute last resort. The goal is to have everyone with a cliché that _isn't_ "none".

### Actor Name

The ... name of the actor. If there are multiple actors, add multiple rows. Put the most known actor (or the most current) on top.

### Shows

This section is a repeatable field.

* Show Name - This is a dropdown. If the show isn't listed, that's okay you can leave it blank. It's best to add the show, even if we don't publish it, just so it can be filled in later. You can add a new row if someone is on multiple shows (Lucretia from the Spartacus series, Janet King from her own show and Crownies, for example).
* Character Type - Main cast is easy. Recurring and guest are semantics. If they have their own plot, they're probably recurring. If they only have one episode, they're probably guests.

_All blog posts are written in [Gutenberg](https://wordpress.org/plugins/gutenberg/)_

If you want to play with it in a safe space, you can use [Frontenberg](http://moc.co/sandbox/example-post/) or login and go to the [local Gutenberg test page](https://lezwatchtv.com/wp-admin/post-new.php?gutenberg-demo).

If you have any issues, come talk to Mika. This is her fault.

## Overview

Blog posts should be staggered somewhat, so we don't overlap too much. Some posts have a weekly scheduled, so please be aware when scheduling posts

## Post Types

The following kinds of content are posted regularly. Just because something isn't listed doesn't mean we don't post it, just that it's not common.

* Breaking News: These are to be posted as soon as possible. Recommended title "Breaking News: [The Thing]"
* Exclusives: Interviews (for the most part). They should be scheduled and perferably no more than one a week.
* Listicles: i.e. 'Best Wall Makeout Scenes' posts. These use a special block called "Listicle"
* The Queerest Thing I Watched: Tracy posts this every Monday. Try not to schedule anything else at the same time.

## Gutenberg Notes

For people who are new to Gutenberg it can be a serious paradigm shift in how you write with WordPress.

Deep breath.

Most everything is "just write." If you have a twitter link, or a video, just paste in the URL into an empty line (aka a block) and it will auto convert. We have created custom blocks to make certain repetable actions easier:

### Listicles

Type `/listicle` into a fresh line on Gutenberg:

![Listicle Example]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/listicle-example.jpg)

Click on "Listicle" and it will generate a block that has two options for Listicle items.

![Listicle Block in Place]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/listicle-block.jpg)

Each item gets a title and then below it you can add content. Use the buttons at the bottom to add or remove items. If you want to have a reverse list (for a countdown) you can use the "Toggle Order" to reverse.
